# Snippets And Tidbits
## Guides and references to data structures, useful concepts, and other valuable information

This repository is intended to be the culmination of various resources, references, and anything else I find might be useful and reference with some level of frequency. I thought it would be fun and useful to try and organize everything into a monorepo that I can use as a reference, compendium, handbook - whatever! I am also hoping to keep this somewhat language agnostic. I hope to include many languages, and may even implement some examples in multiple languages.

At some point, this README will be more fleshed out and become an overarching directory for the monorepo, but I'm still figuring out how to structure things, and I don't want to have to rewrite this a bunch as I change things.

I hope, if you've stumbled upon this repo, that you find it useful! If you notice any inaccuracies or want to add something new here, don't hesitate to reach out, submit a PR, or fork and maintain your own copy!
