# Snippets And Tidbits
## Guides and references to data structures, useful concepts, and other valuable information

This repository is intended to be the culmination of various resources, references, and anything else I find might be useful and reference with some level of frequency. I thought it would be fun and useful to try and organize everything into a monorepo that I can use as a reference, compendium, handbook - whatever!

At some point, this README will be more fleshed out and become an overarching directory for the monorepo, but I'm still figuring out how to structure things, and I don't want to have to rewrite this a bunch as I change things.

I hope, if you've stumbled upon this repo, that you find it very useful! If you notice any inaccuracies or want to add something new here, don't hesitate to reach out, submit a PR, or fork and maintain your own copy!
