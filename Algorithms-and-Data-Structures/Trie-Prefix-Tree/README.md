# Trie/Prefix Tree

A Trie, or Prefix Tree, is an ordered search tree structure where each keys position determines its associated keys.
Every child node shares a common prefix with its parent node, and the root node represents the empty string.
This is a unique structure best suited for tasks such as autocomplete, dictionary search, IP routing, etc.
